Click-IPMP
##########

This package aims to implement the core functions of IPMP, the
IP Measurement Protocol, Draft version 5. See the thesis of Matthew
Luckie on IPMP:

http://www.wand.net.nz/~mluckie/pubs/mluckie-thesis.pdf

It includes the latest Draft, v5, in its appendix.

The Draft apparently didn't reach the status of a final RFC.

To use Click-IPMP, just put the module in your data path. It acts as a IPMP
ping forwarder and -responder (most importantly, it puts Path Records in the
packets that flow through).  For example configurations, see the files in the
conf-examples/ directory.  For more information on how to use the element,
see ipmp_el.hh.
