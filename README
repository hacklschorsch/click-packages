iias: gre and ppp
.................

    iias stands for Internet-In-A-Slice.  The gre and ppp packages, from
    Mark Huang, define GRE header, PPP, and PPTP elements.  In ppp, the
    PPTPServer element enables the user-level driver to act as a PPTP
    concentrator.  Much of the code is derived from the PoPToP PPTP server
    package, distributed under the GPL, and the PPPD PPP package,
    distributed under the CMU BSD license.  The iias/conf directory
    provides sample configuration files for the gre and ppp packages, that
    enable an IP overlay network to be created on PlanetLab.
